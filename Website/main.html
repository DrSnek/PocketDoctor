								<p>This is a project made by the the Pathfinding Pioneers. We are a group of 11th grade students from Greenwoodhigh International School on a mission to innovate the healthcare sector. </p>
								<p> 
									The diseases that our website supports are: <br>
									- Diabetes <br>
									- Coronary Artery Disease <br>
									- Chronic Kidney Disease <br>

								<h3>Theme: Healthcare</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Our mission:</h4>
								<p>The goal of this project is to make standardised healthcare more accessible and cheaper in rural areas. Basic medical equipment can be acquired in rural areas making it possible to obtian non-intrusive data from the user. Our algorithms analyse this data and run it through datasets to determine the risk of a person having any of the diseases our website currently supports. This is a huge innovation in this field eliminating the need for expensive equipment.</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Algorithm</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This project is a machine learning algorithm that detects the risk of getting a disease based on basic information provided by the user, and can be a powerful tool for identifying potential health risks and guiding patients through preventative measures. By analyzing data such as age, gender, blood sugar level, and lifestyle habits, the algorithm can identify patterns and make predictions about an individual's risk of developing a specific disease. Additionally, it can also learn from new data and continuously improve its predictions over time. This can allow individuals to get a more accurate and personalized assessment of their risk, as well as provide healthcare professionals with additional tools to support their patients in managing and preventing diseases.</p>
